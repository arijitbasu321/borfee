Programming language: Python3
database: MariaDB

Architecture:

Database tables:
master node
submission node
execution node
queues
jobs


Roles:
1) client:
    > Job submission
2) server:
    > database
    > scheduling & resource matching
    > connection with execute node
3) execution: (master/slave)
    > execution of job

4) logging and accounting
    > logging
    > accounting system activity
5) monitoring
    > monitor system resources

modules:
    1) central module
       * Recives requests from command and store them in a buffer
       * Take request from the buffer and act on it
            > scheduler (resource matching)
            > execution master part (with connector)
       * also periodically runs scheduling and execution

    2) command module
       * Writes info to database
       * notifies central module




queues: [
   queue1: {
     jobs: [
       job1 {},
       job2: {}
     ],
     nodes: [
        node1: {},
        node2: {}
     ]
     }
